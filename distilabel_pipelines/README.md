# distilabel pipelines

We used [`distilabel`](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel) to create several pipelines for generating instruction-following and multi-turn datasets for the post-training of SmolLM2.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is still in WIP. We will upload the rest of the pipelines soon. Thanks for your patience!
